# Start with enabling shell scripts on you linux systems

Create a .bin folder in your home directory and copy all the shell scripts present in the repo in that folder
Then we just have to change the permissions of that folder so we can access any shell script from anywhere on terminal.

```
cd ~/
mkdir bin
sudo chmod +x bin
```

make sure everytime you add a new shell script run the permission change command.
